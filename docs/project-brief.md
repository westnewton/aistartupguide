# AIStartupGuide.com — Project Brief

**Last updated:** February 2026
**Owner:** Jason Nista (Wilmington, NC)
**Status:** Homepage (v3) + Industry page template (v2) complete, ready for build-out

---

## Mission

Help small and medium business owners discover, evaluate, and implement AI tools specific to their industry. The site is a curated, independent resource hub — not a generic AI directory.

## Core Value Proposition

"Stop sifting through thousands of AI products. We test and curate the best tools for small businesses — organized by your industry, explained in plain English."

The differentiator vs. generic directories (There's An AI For That, FutureTools, etc.) is **vertical specificity and trust**. We tell a plumber which 5 tools matter to them and why, written by someone who understands their business. Google's E-E-A-T framework rewards this approach.

---

## Target Audience

- Small/medium business owners (1–50 employees)
- Independent contractors, agents, sole proprietors
- Not developers or tech-savvy users — plain English is essential
- Decision-makers who Google things like "best AI tools for electricians" or "AI scheduling for hair salons"

## Tone & Language

- Practical, not hype-driven
- Plain English, not jargon
- Honest — flag what's hype vs. what actually saves time
- Warm but authoritative (think Wirecutter, not TechCrunch)
- Avoid "blue collar" framing — use "business" and "industry" language

---

## Revenue Model — Three Lanes

### 1. Affiliate Revenue (Primary)
- Most SaaS tools have affiliate programs paying $20–$200+ per signup
- Tool reviews and recommendation pages naturally drive clicks
- Model: Wirecutter / NerdWallet style
- Affiliate links embedded in tool reviews, comparison pages, and "top picks" features

### 2. Email Newsletter → Sponsored Content (Secondary)
- Weekly/biweekly newsletter: "This week's best AI finds for small business"
- Builds an owned audience independent of Google traffic
- Once subscriber base grows (target: few thousand), AI tool companies pay for featured placement
- Insurance policy against search algorithm changes

### 3. Consulting / Implementation Upsell (Tertiary)
- 1-on-1 setup sessions at $100–$200/hour
- For visitors who find the right tool but need hands-on help
- Keeps founder close to real user pain points
- Feeds back into better content and reviews
- Booking page on site

## Industry Categories (Data-Backed)

Ordered by SBA/Census small business count in the U.S.:

| # | Category | U.S. Businesses | Notes |
|---|----------|----------------|-------|
| 1 | Professional Services | 4.6M | Accountants, lawyers, consultants, engineers, architects |
| 2 | Construction & Trades | 3.6M | GCs, electricians, plumbers, HVAC, roofers |
| 3 | Transportation & Logistics | 3.4M | Trucking, moving, delivery, freight, couriers |
| 4 | Real Estate | 3.3M | Agents, brokerages, property management, inspections |
| 5 | Retail & E-Commerce | 2.9M | Shops, boutiques, online stores, specialty, convenience |
| 6 | Food & Restaurants | Top by new openings | Restaurants, cafés, food trucks, catering, bars |
| 7 | Health & Wellness | 10% of all SMBs | Doctors, dentists, chiropractors, fitness, PT |
| 8 | Home & Personal Services | Fastest-growing | Cleaning, landscaping, salons, pet care, auto repair |

**Launch strategy:** Start with 3 verticals max (likely Construction, Real Estate, Personal Services — underserved by existing AI content, owner-operated decision makers, manageable tool landscape). Expand once the playbook is proven.

## Industry Page Architecture (Key Decisions)

These decisions apply to every industry landing page and should be followed when replicating across verticals:

### Tool Organization
- Tools organized by **function** (what they do), not by profession (who uses them)
- 6 functional categories per industry (e.g., for Construction: Estimating, Scheduling, Communication, Invoicing, Marketing, Documentation)
- **3–4 tools per category** (covers free, mid-range, and premium options)
- ~18–24 tool cards per industry page total
- Each tool card includes: name, pricing badge, sourced star rating (G2 or Capterra), plain-English description, "best for" tags, and "Check it out →" link

### Profession Targeting Without Sub-Pages
- No sub-pages per profession at launch (no /construction/plumbers, etc.)
- Instead, use **"best for" tags** on tool cards (e.g., "Solo operators", "1–15 person crews", "GCs & remodelers", "Commercial")
- A plumber and an electrician see themselves in the same tags — business size and work type matter more than trade
- Sub-pages only if traffic data later shows demand for profession-specific content

### Page Structure (top to bottom)
1. Breadcrumb (Home > Industries > [Industry])
2. FTC affiliate disclosure banner
3. Industry hero (H1 = exact search query, e.g., "AI Tools for Construction & Trades")
4. Quick Picks — top 3 tools above the fold with ratings, pricing, one-line verdicts
5. Jump nav — category anchor links (also become Google sitelinks)
6. Tool categories — each with H2 header (keyword target), intro paragraph, 3–4 tool cards
7. Comparison callouts — inline banners linking to "[Tool A] vs [Tool B]" pages between relevant categories
8. Getting Started section — 4-step beginner advice, consulting upsell at step 4
9. Industry-specific newsletter CTA
10. Footer

### Ratings Strategy
- Use **G2 and Capterra ratings with attribution** (e.g., "★ 4.5 Capterra")
- Manually pull from public pages — no API needed
- Display whichever platform has more reviews or a more relevant audience for that tool
- No proprietary rating system at launch — not enough authority yet

### Link Strategy
- "Check it out →" links go to tool homepage initially; swap to affiliate URLs as partnerships are set up
- No individual review pages at launch — the tool card description IS the review for now
- Write full review pages later for tools with the highest click-through rates (let data decide)
- Comparison callout links can be placeholders initially, built out as high-value SEO pages over time

### SEO Approach
- H1 = the search query ("AI Tools for [Industry]")
- Each H2 category header is its own keyword target ("Estimating & Quoting Tools")
- Meta description targets long-tail variations including specific professions
- Jump nav anchors can appear as Google sitelinks
- Breadcrumbs provide structured data
- Industry-specific newsletter copy adds topical relevance signals

### Replicating Across Verticals
To build a new industry page:
1. Identify 6 functional categories relevant to that industry
2. Research 3–4 tools per category (mix of free/mid/premium)
3. Pull G2 or Capterra rating for each tool
4. Write plain-English descriptions with "best for" tags
5. Identify 2–3 natural comparison matchups for callout banners
6. Customize Getting Started tips for the industry
7. Write industry-specific newsletter CTA copy
8. Set industry accent color (each vertical has its own color variable)

## Content Strategy

### Per Industry Vertical (launch version)
- 1 industry landing page with 6 functional categories, 18–24 tool cards
- "Check it out" links to tool homepages (affiliate links added later)
- 2–3 comparison article placeholders (built out post-launch based on traffic)
- Industry-specific newsletter CTA copy

### Per Industry Vertical (post-launch, based on traffic data)
- Individual tool review pages for top-clicked tools (deep-dive: screenshots, pros/cons, pricing, alternatives)
- Full comparison articles ("Jobber vs Housecall Pro for HVAC")
- Setup/implementation guides

### Blog (supplementary)
- Broader content: "How to Use ChatGPT to Write Better Estimates"
- Cross-industry guides: "5 AI Tools Every Sole Proprietor Should Know About"
- Weekly/biweekly cadence

### Newsletter
- Weekly email with new tool discoveries and industry-specific tips
- Drives return traffic and builds owned audience

---

## Competitive Positioning

- **Generic directories** list thousands of tools with no context → we curate by industry
- **YouTube creators** cover AI broadly → we go deep on specific trades
- **Software review sites** (G2, Capterra) aren't organized by small business vertical → we are
- **Defensibility:** Vertical expertise + trust + E-E-A-T signals are hard to replicate at scale

---

## Growth Sequence

| Phase | Timeline | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Months 1–3 | Build 3 industry verticals, 30–40 pages indexed, capture long-tail search traffic |
| 2 | Months 3–6 | Layer in newsletter, start affiliate partnerships |
| 3 | Months 6–9 | Add consulting upsell, expand into new industries |
| 4 | Months 9–12 | Full 8 verticals, sponsored newsletter placements, scale content |

## Technical Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Hosting:** Vercel (existing account)
- **Repo:** GitHub (existing workflow)
- **Why Next.js:** Consistency with Jason's existing Next.js project on Vercel. Same framework, same deployment pipeline, same mental model. Static generation via `generateStaticParams` for SEO performance. React Server Components minimize client-side JS. `next/font/google` for optimized font loading. Future-proof if the site needs API routes, auth, or dynamic features later.
- **CSS:** Vanilla CSS with custom properties (no Tailwind) — design system already built
- **Migrating from:** B12 (to be retired)
- **Domain:** aistartupguide.com (status TBD — needs to be purchased or confirmed)

---

## Design Principles

- **Aesthetic:** Warm, editorial (Wirecutter-inspired), not techy
- **Fonts:** DM Serif Display (headings) + DM Sans (body)
- **Palette:** Warm paper (#faf8f5), terracotta accent (#c45d3e), dark ink (#1a1a1a), sage green for "free" tags, muted tones throughout
- **Layout:** Clean cards, generous whitespace, scroll-triggered fade-up animations
- **Key decisions:**
  - No floating badge above H1 — hero goes straight to headline
  - Hero preview card is **industry-neutral** ("Popular This Week") to avoid pigeon-holing
  - H1 must stay above the fold (compact nav, tight hero padding, min-height on hero)
  - Floating badges are generic ("120+ tools reviewed", "Tested by real owners")
  - FAQ replaces "How It Works" — more value, addresses real objections
  - Each industry card shows U.S. business count for credibility
  - Industry cards are color-coded by vertical
